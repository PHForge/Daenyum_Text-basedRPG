# Daenyum - Text-based RPG Combat

**Daenyum** is a retro-inspired, text-based RPG combat game written in C, designed to evoke the charm of 1980s console games. Featuring turn-based battles, character progression, multilingual support, and random events, Daenyum offers an immersive experience for players.

## Features

- **Retro ASCII Banner**: Displays a stylized "DAENYUM, Text-based RPG Combat by PHForge" banner at startup.
- **Dynamic Characters**: Players and enemies are defined by a `Character` struct with attributes (name, HP, attack, defense, dodge, crit, luck).
- **Progression System**: Players gain experience (XP) to level up, with automatic stat improvements. Enemies scale with player level. Defeated players are revived with reset stats.
- **Turn-based Combat**: Engaging battles where players and enemies attack until one reaches 0 HP.
- **Randomized Damage**: Damage calculations incorporate randomness, influenced by defense, dodge, crit, and luck stats.
- **Interactive Menu**:
  - **Start Adventure**: Initiate a combat in a random environment (cave, dungeon, labyrinth, forest).
  - **View Stats**: Display player statistics.
  - **Settings**: Switch languages (English, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese).
  - **Credits**: A heartfelt dedication to my wife and son for their support.
  - **Quit**: Exit the game gracefully.
- **Save/Load System**: Persist player profiles between sessions.
- **Varied Enemies**: Encounter different enemy types (e.g., Goblin, Troll) selected randomly.
- **Combat Environments**: Battle in atmospheric locations (cave, dungeon, labyrinth, forest).
- **Random Events**: Unexpected events like "Divine Intervention" (revives player), "Celestial Shock" (stat boost), or "Curse" (enemy debuff).
- **Flee Mechanism**: Option to flee combat, with success based on the luck stat.
